        <h1>Getting to know me...</h1>
        <p>My name is Andrew Enyeart and I was born in Indiana, but we moved to Hawaii when I was two, then several other states after that. Washington State has been home for 19 years! I've taken some intro programming courses before, but my degree is in Linguistics, and my field of greatest expertise is actually cocktail bartending. One of my current goals is to get at least three weight-lifting sessions in per week while doing Code Fellows!</p>
